# 100daysofcode

100 days of code is a challenge where the goal is to programm for 100 consecutive days. The only rules are to do it at least for 1 hour and it has to be for personal projects and selfdevelopment only. 
Programming at work doesnâ€™t count because than it would be no challenge.

The motivation to do this challange came from Robert Wades Medium article:
